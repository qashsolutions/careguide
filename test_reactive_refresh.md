# Testing the Reactive Dashboard Refresh

## Changes Made

### 1. FirebaseGroupService.swift
- Added notification posting in `currentGroup` didSet (line 44-49)
- Added `Notification.Name.firebaseGroupDidChange` extension (line 858-860)
- Now posts notification whenever group changes (set or cleared)

### 2. MyHealthDashboardView.swift  
- Added `.onReceive` listener for group change notifications (line 73-79)
- Forces dashboard reload when notification received
- Added `loadDataIfNeeded()` helper function (line 404-420)
- Logs current group to help debug

### 3. GroupDashboardView.swift
- Added `.onChange` of `viewModel.activeGroupId` (line 97-105)
- Posts group change notification as backup when group becomes active

## How It Works

1. **When Secondary User Joins Group:**
   - `FirebaseGroupService.joinGroup()` sets `currentGroup`
   - This triggers `didSet` which posts notification
   - Dashboard receives notification and reloads
   - Dashboard now fetches from Firebase instead of Core Data

2. **When App Restarts:**
   - `FirebaseGroupService.loadSavedGroup()` restores group from UserDefaults
   - Sets `currentGroup` which posts notification
   - Dashboard loads with Firebase data immediately

3. **When User Creates New Group:**
   - `FirebaseGroupService.createGroup()` sets `currentGroup`
   - Notification posted, dashboard refreshes
   - Shows Firebase data

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Secondary User Join
1. **Primary Phone:**
   - Open app
   - Create group (note invite code)
   - Add medication "TestMed123"

2. **Secondary Phone:**
   - Delete app to clear all data
   - Reinstall and open
   - Join with invite code
   - **Expected:** Dashboard immediately shows "TestMed123"

### Test 2: App Restart
1. After Test 1, on **Secondary Phone:**
   - Force quit app
   - Reopen app
   - **Expected:** Dashboard still shows "TestMed123" (from Firebase)

### Test 3: Real-time Updates
1. **Primary Phone:**
   - Add new medication "TestMed456"

2. **Secondary Phone (already in group):**
   - Should see "TestMed456" appear within seconds
   - (Due to Firebase listeners in FirebaseGroupDataService)

## Debug Output to Look For

When secondary user joins group:
```
üì± Group changed - reloading dashboard data
üîç DEBUG: MyHealthDashboardView loading data...
   Current group: Sample only
üîç DEBUG: Loaded 1 items
```

When app restarts with saved group:
```
‚úÖ Restored Firebase group: Sample only
üîç DEBUG: MyHealthDashboardView loading data...
   Current group: Sample only
```

## Verification

Check these to confirm it's working:
1. Dashboard shows Firebase data (not empty Core Data)
2. Read-only banner appears for secondary users
3. Group name shows in Settings tab
4. Data persists across app restarts

## Rollback

If issues occur, remove:
1. Notification posting from FirebaseGroupService (lines 44-49, 858-860)
2. onReceive from MyHealthDashboardView (lines 73-79)
3. onChange from GroupDashboardView (lines 97-105)
